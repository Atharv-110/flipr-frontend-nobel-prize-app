## Features:
- Load More Rows: This will not load all the data at once, only 10 rows at once will load and we can load more rows through **Load More Rows Button**
- Fully Mobile Responsive.
- **> 1 Button** in Mobile View: This will showcase *Task no. 5* in the *Mobile View*.
- Minimal UI for better User Experience. UI inspiration: [**Flipr.ai**](https://flipr.ai/)
- Handled the missing values through logic, eg: There were many Laureates with only Firstname and no Surname. It was showing undefined on the app so handled it via ternary operators.
- Implemented all the basic UI elements such as Navbar, Hero Section, Footer, Modal, etc.
